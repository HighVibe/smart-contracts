Goals/Event Periods
=========================================================

The public ICO will consist of 2 separate selling periods, the Public Token Presale period and the Main Token Sale event period. Both the presale and main event periods will each sell a total of 1,200,000,000 (1.2 Billion) tokens. 

The Public Token Presale period will begin on July 7th, 2018 and conclude on August 8th, 2018 or if the total tokens allotted for this event sell out. It will consist of 3 bonus tiers of 25%, 20% and 15%. The first 240,000,000 tokens sold will come with a 25% bonus, totalling 300,000,000 tokens for the first tier. The second tier will sell 250,000,000 tokens with an accompanying bonus of 20%, totalling 300,000,000 tokens. The final tier for the Public Token Presale will sell 521,739,130 tokens with a bonus of 15%, completing the Presale with 600,000,000 tokens sold for this tier and 1,200,000,000 total tokens sold overall.

The Main Token Sale event period will begin on August 8th, 2018 and will conclude on September 9th, 2018 or if the total tokens allotted for this event sell out. It will consist of 4 separate selling tiers of 10%, 7.5%, 5% and finally a no bonus tier. The first 272,727,273 tokens sold will fall in the first tier, earning a 10% bonus on all tokens sold for a total of 300,000,000 tokens. The next 279,069,767 tokens sold will fall under the second tier, earning a 7.5% bonus for all tokens sold for a total of 300,000,000 for this tier. The third tier will sell a total of 285,714,286 tokens with a 5% bonus, totalling 300,000,000 tokens. The final tier, consisting of no bonus, will sell 300,000,000 tokens, completing the Main Token Sale event with a grand total of 1,200,000,000 tokens sold. 


Execution
==========================================================

In order to accomplish these goals, we will utilize the tranched pricing strategy implemented in EthTranchePricing.sol alongside the other base ICO smart contracts.
